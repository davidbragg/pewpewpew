Proof of concept of a vertically scrolling shmup in the style of games like Twin Cobra, 1942, and Raiden. This project was originally started in [l√∂ve](https://love2d.org) but has since switched into Godot.

It will be a single level with endless waves of increasing difficulty and a high score. There are limited enemies, an infinitely looping background, and a single attack for the player.

### Purpose

This project was started immediately after the [Pong Clone](https://github.com/davidbragg/pong) and is meant to continue building projects to gain experience with 2D game dev using Godot and GDScript. It is not meant to be a fully featured game.
