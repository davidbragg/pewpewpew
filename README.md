Proof of concept of a vertically scrolling shmup in the style of games like Twin Cobra, 1942, and Raiden. This project was originally started in [l√∂ve](https://love2d.org) but has since switched into Godot.

The purpose of the project is get some experience with Godot and developing in GDScript. It is not meant to be a fully featured game.
