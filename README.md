PoC a vertically scrolling shmup (Twin Cobra/Raiden/1942 style) in löve.

I have no idea what I'm doing, so I plan to walk through and build a bunch of little experiments to figure out the pieces that I need to make this work. Ideally, I should be able to walk through the various experiments and use that to build out the full PoC. 

I'll probably document some things while I'm in the process. These aren't notes meant for other people. These are the kind of notes I make for myself while I'm trying things out. 

It's worth noting. I am not a game developer, have never touched löve before, don't know any lua, and really have clue what I'm doing in general. Take anything you see in here with a grain of salt and consider that I may be doing things absolutely wrong.

The `required` section of [todo.md](todo.md) is the extent of what I would really like to get done with this project. If I get further, that would be alright as well.
