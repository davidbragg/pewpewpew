PoC a vertically scrolling shmup (Twin Cobra/Raiden/1942 style) in l√∂ve.

I have no idea what I'm doing, so I plan to walk through and build a bunch of little experiments to figure out the pieces that I need to make this work. Ideally, I should be able to walk through the various experiments and use that to build out the full PoC. 

I'll probably document some things while I'm in the process.
