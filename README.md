# pewpewpew

Proof of concept of a vertically scrolling shmup in the style of Twin Cobra, 1942, and Raiden. This project was originally started (and abandoned) in [l√∂ve](https://love2d.org) and later switched to Godot.

This is not a full game, but an exercise to get experience with Godot. See purpose statement below.

See [itch.io page](https://heavyliftingindustries.itch.io/pewpewpew) for builds or build your own. Original created with Godot 4.2.1.

### gameplay

* move (WASD or controller analog left stick)
* shoot (space or controller A (Xbox)/X (PS))
* auto fire - hold shoot

Single level with endless waves of enemies. Waves get progressively more difficult the longer the player survives.

Player gets three lives to attempt for a high score.

### known bugs

None that I know of. There's almost certainly something creeping under the surface that I haven't seen yet.

### limitations

The code is definitely chunky. Approaches improved towards the end, but aren't always reflected in older parts of the codebase. It could definitely be refactored and cleaned up.

Some simple UI clean up, sound effects, music, and death animations would go a long way to improving the presentation/experience.

I have no plans to tackle any of this.

### purpose

This project was started immediately after finishing work on [Pong Clone](https://github.com/davidbragg/pong) and was meant to continue building projects to gain experience with 2D game dev using Godot and GDScript. It is not meant to be a fully featured game.

The project was constrained to a two week, part time development schedule. The feature set was deliberately constrained both to meet the schedule and limit focus primarily to game logic. There is no sound, no level design, the UI is barebones, and only the minimum of control is implemented.
